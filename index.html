        <p class="lede-paragraph">The international community for the Python programming language holds several conferences (PyCons) each year and <strong>we want you to join us</strong>.</p>
        <p>Whether you are an experenced programmer, a hobby hacker or an absolute begginer, we'd love to welcome you to the Python community.</p>
        <p>PyCons are hosted all around the world, with most organised by volunteers from local Python communities.</p>
        <p>This means that each Pycon is unique, although all PyCons share the same spirit: to spread knowledge, meet new people and learn from each other.</p>
